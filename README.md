# Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction repository! 📊🔍 This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Designed for data scientists, analysts, and business professionals, this project aims to provide insights into customer retention strategies by identifying potential churners.

## 📜 Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction project utilizes machine learning models to analyze customer behavior and predict which customers are likely to churn. By leveraging historical data, this project helps businesses understand churn patterns and implement strategies to improve customer retention.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Tools and scripts for cleaning and preparing customer data for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Implementations of various machine learning models for churn prediction, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques for creating and selecting features that improve model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Methods for assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing churn predictions and model insights.
